Short ZFR document describing the items below:

Some documents describe processes the user or developer must perform.

c) Source control and build process instruction
	Build process: the set of tools and commands to compile and "build" the system.
	Turn in a SET OF DIRECTIONS to:
		a) Find the build system
		b) Check out its files
		c) Build them
	The instructions should contain a COMPLETE set of commands to extract code from the GitHub repo, compile the code, and start it running.
		Should be written in sufficient detail that an intelligent dev can follow them.
		If the system requires login, provide this info.
	Ideally, the system will have a single command that does a "one-step build," that checks out all source code from the repo, builds all necessary binaries, packages them,
	and places them in known location. (git clone URL "name")
	
	The grader will log in to your GitHub ONCE A WEEK to:
		Count the # of files and lines present in the system
		Number of lines modified
		Log the group's development process.
	LACK OF SIGNIFICANT WEEKLY PROGRESS MIGHT HURT GRADE

d) Data access instructions
	Provide a set of instructions about where the data is sotred, and how to access it.
	Set of directions that tells the grader how to find the data, and how to briefly perform a trivial access of this dat.
		For example, if it is a DB, inform the grader how to connect and make a simple query against it.

========================== ACTUAL DOCUMENT =========================

Source control and build process instruction:
	*** These instructions will assume that GitHub is configured on the current system. ***
	
	For Mac OS X / Linux:
		1) Launch Terminal
		2) cd in to the parent directory in which you want to place the project folder.
		3) Run the command 'git clone https://github.com/coldstar96/cse403.git [NAME]'. Replace [NAME] with whatever you wish to call the project folder.

	For Windows:
		*** SOMEONE WITH A WINDOWS MACHINE DO THIS ***


Data access instructions:
	*** DO THIS ***
